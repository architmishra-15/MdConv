# Sample Document with **Bold**, *Italic*, and `Code` in Heading

This is a paragraph with various inline formatting options:

- *This is italic with stars*
- _This is italic with underscores_
- **This is bold with double stars**
- ***This is bold and italic combined***
- `This is inline code`

## More Examples with `Inline Code`

Here's a paragraph with mixed formatting: You can have *italic text*, **bold text**, ***bold italic text***, and `inline code` all in the same sentence. 

You can also mix _underscore italic_ with **star bold** and `code snippets` like `npm install` or `git commit -m "message"`.

> This is a blockquote with **bold text** and *italic text*.
> It can span multiple lines and include `inline code` too.
>
> You can even have multiple paragraphs in blockquotes.

### Code Example

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, **this won't be bold in code**")
    // *This won't be italic either*
    // `This won't be inline code`
}
```

### List with Formatting

- **Bold item** with `inline code`
- *Italic item* with normal text  
- ***Bold italic item*** with `more code`
- Regular item with **bold part**, *italic part*, and `code part`

### Blockquotes

> **Important Note**: This is a blockquote with emphasis.
> 
> You can use `code` inside blockquotes, and even ***bold italic*** text.
> Multiple lines work seamlessly.

> Single line blockquote with `inline code`.

### Another Paragraph

This paragraph demonstrates: ***very important text***, some **bold text**, some *italic text*, and `inline code` all together.

The `code` function returns a `string` value. You can also use variables like `userName` or `isActive` in your text.

Normal text continues here without any formatting.
